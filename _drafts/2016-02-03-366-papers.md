I stumbled upon a Twiiter hashtag `#366paper`. The text usually associated with this is a summary or the title of an article they read. Presumably, they have read the paper and will read an article every day of this year (which happens to be a leap year!). 

As a graduate student, I find this challenge great. It'll help me make a habit of reading journal articles. Additionally, I hope to keep a log of the papers I read with this post. So I will regularly update this post with new papers I read and links to them. Enjoy and wish me luck!
