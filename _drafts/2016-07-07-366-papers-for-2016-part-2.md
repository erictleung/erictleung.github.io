# Papers Log

7. Jul 9. Waldor, Matthew K., et al. ["Where Next for Microbiome
   Research?"][jul9waldor].  PLoS Biol 13.1 (2015): e1002050.
   - Short pieces by scientists on what they this is next
   - Move from describing the composition to assembly, dynamics, and
     function
   - Need for systems-biology-based approaches to understand dynamics and
     function of microbial communities
   - Think about evolution of microbial assemblies
   - Need to understand mechanistic basis of microbiome interactions
   - Exciting area of research in microbiome interactions in skin disorders
     and in nutrition
   - Creation of synthetic microbiomes to engineer a microbiome
6. Jul 7. ["Raising standards in microbiome research"][jul07]. Editorial.
   *Nature Microbiology*. 16112 (2016): 1
   - Need for standard operating procedures in microbiome research for
     interrogation of microbiome and assessment
   - Microbiome research has gained lots of attention in host associated or
     environmental areas, such as agriculture
   - "...without rich metadata...attempts to draw comparison between datasets
     generated from different cohorts can also be confounded."
   - International Human Microbiome Standards (IHMS) project was established
   - Need balance in adhering too much to protocols to stifle research and
     unoptimized use of a protocol to a given experiment 
5. Jul 3. Cho, Ilseung, and Martin J. Blaser. ["The human microbiome: at the
   interface of health and disease"][jul03cho]. *Nature Reviews Genetics* 13.4
   (2012): 260-270.
   - Review of microbiome research up until 2012
   - Discusses characterization and variation of the microbiome
   - Discusses various microbiomes (cutaneous, gastric, gastrointestinal) and
     their relation to IBD, colorectal cancer, and liver disease
   - Discusses effects of the microbiome from birth to adulthood
