Recenty, I was inspired by this tweet on using JavaScript to create a
executable command line business card.

This recently came up and I was curious as to whether I could do it in R. Turns
out, you can.

## Brief research

I didn't know how to make all parts of a card,
so I did some research.

First,
I needed to know how to create an R package.
And there's a great
[online book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
just for this.

Second,
I needed to know how to create colored text.
Turns out,
there's a package called
[crayon](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon)
with this exact functionality.

Lastly,
I wanted to wrap the contents of the card with a box.
And to my surprise,
I was able to find just right package,
the
[cli](https://github.com/r-lib/cli)
package.
