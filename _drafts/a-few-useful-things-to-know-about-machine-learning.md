title: A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning Part 1
category: data science
---

I ran into this very enticing paper ["A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine
Learning"][ml_paper] by [Pedro Domingos][pedro], who is at the University of
Washington.  Myself being in bioinformatics and computational, I have run into
lots of machine learning (or statical learning if you will) algorithms since I
have chosen to be in this field. I plan on writing a summary of the useful tips
on machine learning and then comment on my interpretation and understanding of
the concept.
