title: "A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning Part 1"
---

I ran into this very enticing paper "A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine
Learning" by [Pedro Domingos][pedro], who is at the University of Washington.
Myself being in bioinformatics and computational, I have run into lots of
machine learning (or statical learning if you will) algorithms since I have
chosen to be in this field. I plan on writing a summary of the useful tips on
machine learning and then comment on my interpretation and understanding of the
concept.
