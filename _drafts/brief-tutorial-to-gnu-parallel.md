Estimated time to read: 10 minutes

GNU `parallel` is a shell tool that allows you to execute jobs in parallel on one
or more computers. Here, I will demonstrate some of the power of this tool. A
lot of the material from this comes from the official tutorial on their website
[here](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_tutorial.html).
