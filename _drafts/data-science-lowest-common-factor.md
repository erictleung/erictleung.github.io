title: Data science engineers should make tools for lowest common denominators

My team is lucky to have a dedicated data engineering group. In their time, they have developed a number of internal tools for our team. This contrasts what I've experienced in the past when I was the one developing tools for me to use.

So here are some thoughts I've had on what having a dedicated data enginenering team for the tools we use feels like. Overall, it's been great to off-load some development. And over time, I've reflected on what it's like to make tools for yourself versus another team.


## Tools for myself don't have any rules

As more of a builder data scientist, I've made my fair share of functions or tools. One thing that happenes is the obvious reduction of standards. I might not document as much. I might not write a robust, general function. I might not make the code easy to refactor.

Another rule I don't have to follow is that I can even use whatever tool or language that I'm most familiar with to use. But I do aim to use the best tool for the job. I'll use R for data visualization. I'll use Python for automating some work.


## Tools for others require mindfulness of your users

Tools made for others require a lot more work. Documentation needs to be better. The design must be better. And being mindful of the lifespan of the tool.

But with simpler with SQL and Python. Usage with skills of data scientist and analysts using the tools.
