I recently stumbled upon a great [lecture series][topics] on current topics in
genomics. The first one set the stage of the thirteen subsequent lectures
ranging from [sequence analysis][sequence] to [genomic medicine][genomic_med].
Here, I'd like to give my summarization of the first lecture, "The Genomic
Landscape circa 2014" by Eric Green.

## The (Human) Genomic Landscape circa 2014 Overview

Eric Green starts off with an overview of his lecture, breaking it down into
three sections:

1. Historical context for genomics
2. Major achievements since the Human Genome Project
3. The human genomics landscape: 2014 and beyond

## History Behind Genomics

There were multiple key individuals who paved the way for the genomics of today.
Here are a few of them:

- [Gregor Mendel][mendel] - father of modern genetics
- [Friedrich Miescher][miescher] - discovered DNA
- [Oswald Avery][avery] - DNA transmits heredity
- [James D. Watson][watson] and [Francis Crick][crick] - widely credited for
  structure of DNA

### Gregor Mendel

We now go into the founding fathers of the field of genomics and genetics. To
start off, you can't talk about genetics without mentioning Gregor Mendel. He
wrote a paper, ["Experiments in Planet Hybridization (1865),"][mendel_paper] and
reads it to a [local scientific organization][local] (links to PDF) where he
outlines the basic ideas of heredity and inheritance we take for granted today.

### Friedrich Miescher

Miescher then came along in 1871 to publish his [findings][miescher_paper],
"Ueber die chemische Zusammensetzung der Eiterzellen," which translates to "On
the chemical composition of pus cells." His experiment involved taking bandages
from hospitals and extracting the molecular material from pus. This led to his
discover of nuclein (a.k.a DNA). A more thorough history of Miescher and his
discovery of DNA can be found in a [review paper by Ralf
Dahm][miescher_history].

### Oswald Avery

Oswald Avery, along with Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty, devised an
experiment to validate the "bacterial transformation" found by [Frederick
Griffith][griffth_exp]. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty published the
[paper][avery_paper], "Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing
Transformation of Pneumococcal Types: Induction of Transformation by a
Deoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III," which was
published February 1st, 1944.

### Watson and Crick

Then in 1953, Watson and Crick published their iconic [paper][watson_crick],
"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic
Acid," in the journal *Nature*. The paper describes the double helical nature of
DNA and the X-ray diffraction and math to prove it.
