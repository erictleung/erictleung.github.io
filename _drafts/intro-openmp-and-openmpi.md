title: Introduction to OpenMP and Open MPI
---

Computers today are getting faster and more powerful everyday. In the past, the
answer to faster computers was to increase the clock speed (e.g. 2.0 GHz to 2.5
GHz) of the computer. This, however, also increases the power consumption of the
computer. This increasing power consumption is not sustainable because with more
power, the most heat that is generated and even more power is needed to cool
down the processors. Thus, faster hardware is not the answer.

The solution for faster computers has now shifted from improving the hardware to
optimizing the software. Instead of just one very fast processor, there would be
smaller but multiple processors doing the work. Thus, parallel processing is
needed and frameworks such as OpenMP and Open MPI were created to facilitate
parallel processing.
