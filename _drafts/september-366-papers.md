title: September 366 Papers
---

Here are the papers I've read through in September. As my qualifying exam is
coming up, I've chosen these papers to be more focused on computational methods
I may run into or I was interested in their experimental design.

12. **Sept 04** Epel, E. S., et al. ["Meditation and vacation effects have an
    impact on disease-associated molecular phenotypes."][sep04epel]
    Translational Psychiatry 6.8 (2016): e880.
11. **Sept 02** Reperant, Leslie A., Guus F. Rimmelzwaan, and Albert DME
    Osterhaus. ["Advances in influenza vaccination."][sep02reperant]
    *F1000prime reports* 6 (2014).
