title: Translational Medicine Talk Summary
published: false
---

I recently attended the [joint conference][ismbeccb2015] between [International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecule Biology][ismb] and [European Conference on Computational Biology][eccb] in Dublin, Ireland. One talk I went to was Winston Hide's talk "Translational Medicine: The Current Landscape and Future Directions." The following is my summary of that talk, along with some personal commentary from me.

On a quick side note, Hide mentions that Russ Altman's [annual Translational Bioinformatics Year in Review talk][tbi_year] has influenced his talk. [Here][tbi_papers] is an awesome list of links from Altman's talk.

## Brief Intro to Translational Medicine

One definition of "translational medicine" is the combination of scientific discovery and health improvement. Another succinct way to put it is a "bench-to-bedside" approach, taking research findings at the "bench" and applying it to the "bedside" where it affects patients, public health, and others fields such as policy. This is a very powerful approach and as Winston Hide puts it, "we're dealing with people, bringing quantitative information to people."

## Beginnings

There were up's and down's to translational sciences through the 1950's and onward. The three up's were induced by pharmacology, affinity assays, and monoclonal antibodies.

Drugs and pharmacology are the first things that come to mind when thinking about bench-to-bedside. You start off finding a binding site of a protein, which when blocked can decrease the amount of a disease inducing agent. What now? Design a drug for it! This boom of translational sciences occured in the 1950's using pharmacological, biochemical, and physiological approaches. 

The next wave of innovation was in the 1980's with affinity assays. My guess is that these are referring to [ligand binding assays][lba]. One possible invention was [Partition Affinity Ligand Assay (PALA)][partial].

Lastly, before getting to where we are now with high throughput sequencing,
