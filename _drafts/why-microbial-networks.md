title: Why Microbial Networks
---

Studying microbial communities is important to gain an understanding of its
role in the environment. Here I present the argument for using microbial
networks as a way to analyze these microbial communities.

## Purpose of microbial research

Microorganisms are everywhere. They're in the soil. They're in our foods.
They're even within us humans. In each place, there is an interest in what
happens to the environment whenever there are changes in the microbial
community, and vice versa. (Here, I reference the microbial community as
bacteria, not including other microorganisms such as fungi and archaea.)

A natural follow-up question to, "What are the microorganisms doing?", is,
["Who's there?"][whosthere] To answer this question, we borrow methods from
other related scientific fields: ecology.

## What is done currently

Studying microbial communities borrows methods from ecology, specifically
macro-ecology that studies larger organisms.

Briefly, current experimental techniques (i.e. 16S rRNA sequencing) allow us to
sample the bacterial communities, assign bacterial taxonomy, and quantify the
assigned taxonomy in our sample. This results in a taxa-by-sample matrix, where
the values are the quantities of the taxa per sample.

Using this matrix, we can calculate do a couple analyses:

1. Microbial diversity
2. Differential abundances
