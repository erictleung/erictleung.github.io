I stumbled upon a Twitter hashtag `#366paper`. The text usually associated with
this is a summary or the title of an article they read. Presumably, they have
read the paper and will read an article every day of this year (which happens to
be a leap year!).

As a graduate student, I find this challenge great. It'll help me make a habit
of reading journal articles. Additionally, I hope to keep a log of the papers I
read with this post. So I will regularly update this post with new papers I read
and links to them. Enjoy and wish me luck!
