Sometimes it would be convenient to write some Unicode characters,
like those letters with accents.
I saw someone on Twitter share them writting them,
but then forgot about it.

Then I randomly ran into it again! And it is easier than I thought.

Accent marks can be created using
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+
<kbd>x</kbd>
<kbd>8</kbd>
and then proceed with the accent mark and then the letter.

For example,
to type Ã©,
press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+
<kbd>x</kbd>
<kbd>8</kbd>
<kbd>'</kbd>
<kbd>e</kbd>.

along with some other great shortcuts for abbreviations of Unicode symbols.
