<p>I have access to a Linux server, but I inconveniently do not have any root
access. This means that installing software was a bit of a pain, because I could
not use the usual <code>apt-get</code> command. Luckily, after many months of not using the
server because I do not have root access, I have found the solution: Linuxbrew.</p>

<p>Paste this into your terminal and it will install Linuxbrew.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">ruby</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you are familiar with <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> from Mac OSX, this is just
a port over to Linux to be your local package manager. </p>

<p>Additional steps to make this work are to add the following to your <code>.bashrc</code>
file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">MANPATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">INFOPATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Afterward, you can start installing away with the following command.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">brew install package_name</code></pre></div>

<p>You can find more documentation <a href="http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/">here</a>.</p>
