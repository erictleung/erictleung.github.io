<h1 class="page-title">Welcome!</h1>

<p class="message">Docendo discimus</p>

I'm currently a fourth year
<a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/people/eric-leung.cfm">PhD student</a>
studying bioinformatics and computational biology at
<a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/">Oregon Health &amp; Science University</a>.
My research interests are in understanding the microbioal ecology of the human
microbiome using computational methods.

I will generally blog about code, data, and the (human) microbiome intended to
be advice and notes for my previous self in order to help my future self. I
hope you're able to takeaway something from it as well.

Previously, I was at the
<a href="https://www.ou.edu">University of Oklahoma</a>
where I received dual Bachelor degrees in
<a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/chemistry.html">biochemistry</a>
and
<a href="http://www.math.ou.edu/">mathematics</a>.

In my free time, I like to fold origami, contribute to open-source projects,
volunteer locally, and learn foreign and programming languages.
