# Welcome!

I'm currently a fifth year
[PhD candidate](//www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/people/eric-leung.cfm)
studying bioinformatics and computational biology at
[Oregon Health & Science University](//www.ohsu.edu/xd/)
My research interests are in understanding the structure of bacteria co-occur
in the human microbiome using computational methods and how best to use this
knowledge to learn about how these bacteria impact our health.

I will generally blog about code, data, and the (human) microbiome intended to
be advice and notes for my previous self in order to help my future self. I
hope you're able to takeaway something from it as well.

Previously, I was at the
[University of Oklahoma](//www.ou.edu)
where I received dual Bachelor degrees in
[biochemistry](//www.ou.edu/cas/chemistry.html)
and
[mathematics](//www.math.ou.edu/)

In my free time, I like to fold origami, contribute to open-source projects,
volunteer locally, and learn foreign and programming languages.

### My Projects

- [`poofsi`](//github.com/erictleung/poofsi) - my R package to teach principles
of statistics based on a Nature series of articles
- [`lalg`](//github.com/erictleung/lalg) - my Python package to facilitate
  learning of linear algebra
- [`erictleung.github.io`](//github.com/erictleung/erictleung.github.io) - this
  website built with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com)
- [`gene-fusion-analysis`](github.com/erictleung/gene-fusion-analysis) - data
  cleaning and basic graph analysis on gene fusions in cancer

### Projects I Contribute To

- [`freeCodeCamp`](//github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) - an open-source
  curriculum and community to teach web development; I've helped edit lessons
  to be more clear and I've written and help contribute to the regular
  expressions lessons
- [BioData Club](//biodata-club.github.io) - an informal, on-campus meetup to
  learn about open research tools and data science skills
- [`r-bootcamp`](//github.com/laderast/r-bootcamp) - bootcamp tutorial on using
  the programming language R
- [freeCodeCamp's 2016 New Coder Survey](//github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) -
  helped clean up the 2016 new coder's survey using R
- [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](//github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey) -
  helped clean up the 2017 new coder's survey using R
- [freeCodeCamp's 2018 New Coder Survey](//github.com/freeCodeCamp/2018-new-coder-survey) -
  helped clean up the 2018 new coder's survey using R
- [`how-to-contribute-to-open-source`](//github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source) -
  I help maintain this list of resources to help new coders to get involved in
  open source project contributions
