I am a PhD student studing bioinformatics and computational biology. My research
interests are broadly in translational bioinformatics, the use of
high-performance computing in genomics research and applications, and natural
language processing.

Previously, I was at the [University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/) where I 
recieved Bachelor degrees in [biochemistry](http://chem.ou.edu/) and 
[mathematics](http://math.ou.edu).
