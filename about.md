> Docendo discimus

I enjoy using data and technology
to better human capabilities,
and teaching what I can along the way.

While completing graduate school,
I gravitated towards work
that involved designing solutions to people's data problems
or teaching others useful skills and concecpts.

I will generally blog
about code, data, and the (human) microbiome
intended to be advice and notes for my previous self
in order to help my future self.

I hope you're able to take away something from it as well.

In my free time, I like to
[contribute to open-source projects](http://resume.github.io/?erictleung),
volunteer locally,
and learn foreign and programming languages.
