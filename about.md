> Docendo discimus

I'm currently a fourth year
[PhD student](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/people/eric-leung.cfm)
studying bioinformatics and computational biology at
[Oregon Health & Science University](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/)
My research interests are in understanding the microbioal ecology of the human
microbiome using computational methods.

I will generally blog about code, data, and the (human) microbiome intended to
be advice and notes for my previous self in order to help my future self. I
hope you're able to takeaway something from it as well.

Previously, I was at the
[University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu)
where I received dual Bachelor degrees in
[biochemistry](http://www.ou.edu/cas/chemistry.html)
and
[mathematics](http://www.math.ou.edu/)

In my free time, I like to fold origami,
[contribute to open-source projects](http://resume.github.io/?erictleung),
volunteer locally, and learn foreign and programming languages.
