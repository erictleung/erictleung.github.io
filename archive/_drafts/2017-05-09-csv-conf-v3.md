I attended my first csv,conf and here are my thoughts on attending.

<!--break-->

I got the opportunity to attend csv,conf this year. It was a matter of
convenience (it was in Portland) and curiousity. I had some colleagues
attending so at the very least, I'd seem some familiar faces.

csv,conf is ["a community conference for data makers everywhere"][csvconf], so
not a conference *just* about the csv data format. The [conference
schedule][schd] was packed with fantastic speakers and topics ([here][ghschd]
is a csv of the schedule for more permanent reference).

Below is a summary of the talks I attended throughout the conference. There are
more talks, which most have been recorded and can be found on their [YouTube
channel][yt].

Designing with data: prototyping at the speed of learning
=========================================================

The [first talk][designdata] I went to was Michelle Hertzfeld's. Her talk was
based on her document ["Little rules for designing with data"][designWithData]
and her experience designing the [USEITI][useiti] website using data.

The four main points of her talk were:

1. Perform research on how the users of the data will interact with your
   content
2. Use real data in prototyping (real data != mock data)
3. Iterative tests through many prototypes to quickly assess what works and
   what doesn't
4. Test most promising prototypes on actual people

These rules are general enough for any data-driven work, ranging from data
analysis or data-driven products.

Michelle is a part of [18F][18f] (a group that works with federal agencies to
create digital services) and they have created a repository of [best practices
across their teams][18fteams] that might be worth keeping for reference.

Designing data exploration: How to make large data sets accessible
==================================================================

[Simon Jockers][jockers] spoke on [designing data explorations][jockerstalk]
and how data engineers and scientists can better make large data sets
accessible.

He first spoke about a story on how the secret documents by the [spy
organization Stasi][stasi] were collected and shared. The information was
shared through a local newspaper where names of former members were listed on
many pages. This is an early method of sharing "data" with the public for them
to explore.

Modern ways of sharing these large data sets might include [Offshore Leaks
Database][icij]. The website provides a web interface to explore the data,
similar to the newpaper publishing of the Stasi information.

This brings into question of should these data be published? Some reasons for
wanting to publish these data might include public interest in the information.
However, the data itself could contain sensitive information and other issues
that might prevent ethical dissemination.

When sharing the data, there is a macro and a micro view of the data. The macro
view is a big, bird's eye view of all the data. For the Offshore Leaks Databse,
the macro view is the [list of organizations][listgroups] or people with these
offshore accounts.  The micro view is narrowing in on each of the data points
that make up the macro view. For the Offshore database, a micro view would be
[a single group][individualgroup] where you can explore specfic information on
their accounts.

News applications today aim to achieve both a macro and micro view of the data
they share. Additionally, news applications can allow you to explore the data
freely, like in ProPublica's project on sharing information on health care
providers' such as [office visits to prescription patterns and habits][vitals].

Additionally, reports such as [this one on exploring the craft beer of the
US][craftbeer] guide you through the data interactively, but you still hold
control on exploring the data yourself as well.

These interactive visualizations are what Simon wanted to share on how to
publish lots of data and make it interesting, balancing direct sharing of data
with displaying various views and allowing explorations.
