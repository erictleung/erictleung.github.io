I recently attended the [Bioinformatics for the Microbiome Symposium
2017][site] at Menlo Park, CA. Here I summarize my takeaways from it.

Award for Microbiome Outreach
=============================

The beginning of the day started out with [Ami Bhatt][bhattlab] giving an award
to [Mark Smith][mark], co-founder of [OpenBiome][openbiome]. OpenBiome is a
nonprofit stool bank which aims to provide safe access to fecal transplants and
facilitate microbiome research.

The one well-known use-case for fecal transplants is for [*Clostridium
difficile*][cdiff], an antibiotic resistant gastrointestinal pathogen. With a
fecal microbiota transplant, it has been found in ["case and small series
reports, about 90% of patients are cured"][cdifffmt]. However, understanding the
mechanism of why this happens is still unknown, and even [efficacy is
variable][currentcdiff].

One amazing milestone Mark shared was in 2013, they treated only six patients
with *C. difficile*. Now, they've treated around 27,0000 patients.
