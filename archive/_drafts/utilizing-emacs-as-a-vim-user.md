title: Utilizing emacs as a vim user
---

Knowing the existence of the [editor wars][war], I can't help but be curious of
the other side.

[war]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war

<!--break-->

For the past six-ish years, I've used [vim][vim] as my sole text editor. While
I've occasionally dabbled in other editors, such as [TextWrangler][textwrangle]
(which I've just found out isn't maintained anymore) and [Atom][atom], I've
always come back to vim for its simplicity of being on the command line,
being ready whenever I need it.

As the title suggests, I've recently took a chance with [emacs][emacs], another
prominent text editor that rivals vim in use. I never really had a use case for
it so it always led to me just trying to exit and then leave it alone. But as
many people are constantly busy, I've been trying to find better ways of
organizing my responsibilities and managing projects and found that emacs
might be what I've been looking for.

## Motivation

As a graduate student, I have a number of responsibilities and projects to work
on. I've tried major project management tools such as Trello and Asana. However,
something about having to go to their sites and interact in this clunky way (I
have to come to prefer text based environments from my time writing code). I
have just found that typing out what I want is much faster and simpler than
point-and-click interfaces. In my opinion.

So I've come to ask questions of using emacs as an academic and come across
questions on StackExchange like, ["Use cases of org-mode as a scientific
productivity tool for academics without programming needs"][academicask].

I have heard [org-mode][orgmode] before, but never really thought of it much.
But after its tag line, I realized it could be the text-based system I've been
wanting.

> Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and
> authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.
