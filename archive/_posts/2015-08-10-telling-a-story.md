Today, I thought about some advice professors have given me in the past while
doing course work. Several have told me when giving a presentation or doing
research that you should tell a story. But yet, they never go into detail about
what that actually means. This can be very frustrating for a learning student!
Every time I have heard that, I always think, "Yeah, I get that. I can make a
story no problem." It turned out to be more difficult the more I thought about
it.

## What does telling a story mean?

Over time, I've gotten a sense of what telling a story means when doing
research. Several years ago, I had a class project for my introduction to
bioinformatics course. Our professor assigned each of us a gene to study and to
"tell a story about it" using the tools we've learned. We learned about analyses
such as: using BLAST to perform sequence alignment; performing multiple sequence
alignments using MUSCLE to find homology; and a network analysis of our assigned
gene and it's expressed protein interactions with other genes products.

## Let's make a story

Now this is some great bioinformatics being done on this gene but when I first
completed the project, each analysis felt disconnected and just put together with
duck tape.

If I were to redo the project, I would make it into a mystery story because all
I was given was the gene with no context. It reminds me of the book [Extremely
Loud and Incredibly Close][book] where the main character, Oskar, discovers a
key in a vase he broke and is curious enough to make it his mission to find out
more information about this mysterious key.

Similar to Oskar's situation where he was given no information about this key,
I should have taken the mind set that there should be a "story" or background of
how this gene came to existence. Did it evolve from another gene? What other
genes are similar to this gene? Maybe those other genes can create a larger lens
through which I can see this gene in?

These questions come a little more naturally to me now that I am a bit older but
it is still a work in progress. But the one thing I have experienced and tend to
forget is that your attitude about your problem will entirely change your
motivation and how your solve the problem. Plus, it might even be fun if you can
make it into a game.
