I'm currently a second year <a href="http://goo.gl/U9RcRX">PhD student</a>
studying bioinformatics and computational biology at 
<a href="http://goo.gl/IIk0ax">Oregon Health & Science University</a>. My 
research interests broadly span translational bioinformatics, the use of
high-performance computing in genomics research and applications, and natural
language processing.

Previously, I was at the <a href="http://goo.gl/aGq1Mi">University of
Oklahoma</a> where I received dual Bachelor degrees in 
<a href="http://goo.gl/v2MiGW">biochemistry</a> and 
<a href="http://goo.gl/QAkNVE">mathematics</a>.
