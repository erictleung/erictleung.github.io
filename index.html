He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without
a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast. <br>

I am a <a href="http://goo.gl/U9RcRX">PhD student</a> studying bioinformatics
and computational biology at <a href="http://goo.gl/IIk0ax">Oregon Health &
Science University</a>. My research interests are broadly in translational
bioinformatics, the use of high-performance computing in genomics research and
applications, and natural language processing.

Previously, I was at the <a href="http://goo.gl/aGq1Mi">University of
Oklahoma</a> where I received Bachelor degrees in 
<a href="http://goo.gl/v2MiGW">biochemistry</a> and 
<a href="http://goo.gl/QAkNVE">mathematics</a>.
