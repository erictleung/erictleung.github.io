    Hello!
    I'm a software engineer at heart, but trained as a data scientist.
    Currently, I work at Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution (DMED).
    When not working, I enjoy learning languages, reading (primarily
    nonfiction) books, and playing tennis.

<p class="text-center">
    I [occasionally write](./blog) about things I've noticed or recurring
    advice I find myself giving.
    I'm also involved [in a number of projects](./projects).
    You can learn more [about me here](./about).
