I am a [PhD student](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/people/eric-leung.cfm) 
studying bioinformatics and computational biology at [Oregon Health & Science
University]
(http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/educational-programs/dmice-programs/computational-biology.cfm).
My research interests are broadly in translational bioinformatics, the use of
high-performance computing in genomics research and applications, and natural
language processing.

Previously, I was at the [University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/) where I 
received Bachelor degrees in [biochemistry](http://chem.ou.edu/) and 
[mathematics](http://math.ou.edu).
