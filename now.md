I have started a new job working from home as a Data Scientist with Disney
working with their ESPN marketing team.

My regular exercise I would have biking to work doesn't happen anymore. So I've
picked up indoor rock climbing and biking to and from there as my regular
exercise.

**Goals for 2021**

- Perform weekly review on all things on my mind
- Finish Mandarin learning tree on Duolingo
- Climb a V5 bouldering route
- Avoid overcommitting myself to projects for this year to recharge
- Take a real vacation

**Habits for 2021**

- Maintain technical knowledge through daily review of spaced repetition cards
- Regularly upkeep digital garden with technical and socioeconomic issues on my
  mind
- Read a book 30 minutes daily
- Use Twitter to document micro-learning
