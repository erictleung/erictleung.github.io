    A description of my workflows and tools.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a data scientist, who dabbles in web development and software engineering.

## What hardware do you use?

I have a number of computing devices I use for different uses.

Personally, I use a [Keychron K4 wireless mechanical keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/collections/all-keyboards/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-version-2#). It was my
first foray into mechanical keyboards.

As a hobby, I am learning stenography using [The Uni keyboard](https://stenokeyboards.com/products/the-uni).

## And what software?

For coding, I use a number of tools depending on the context and language. For
R, I use [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). For Python, I'll use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). For
everything else, I'll use either [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
or [Vim](https://www.vim.org). If I'm accessing a server, I will depend on a
combination of Vim and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

For everyday internet browsing, I use [Firefox](https://firefox.com).

Software I'm hoping to play around with are
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## Productivity

I put all my todo lists in a plain-text file using Emacs and
[Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org). Org-mode is like Markdown, but Emacs-specific
and still wonderfully flexible. To access some relevant files on my phone, I
used [Orgzly](https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android).

## Writing

For writing, I primarily use Emacs and org-mode.

## Reading and Audiobooks

I use a combination of a physical [Kindle]() and the
[LibbyApp](https://libbyapp.com/). The Kindle is to read textbooks or books
that require some time to think in between pages.  The LibbyApp is helpful for
audiobooks and magazines.

## What would be your dream setup?

TBD

## Stationary, notebooks, and pens

My pens:

- [BAMF fountain pen](https://www.desideratapens.com/pens/bamf) from
[The Desiderata Pen Company](https://www.desideratapens.com/)
- [Kaweco Brass Sport fountain pen - fine nib](https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Brass-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/2462)
